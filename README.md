# Portfolio Website  
This is my personal website for showcasing my education, experience, and personal projects. It is also my first complete project using React Native with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. Additionally, I incorporated my computer graphics knowledge by implementing an animated background rendered in real-time with Three.js.  

## Dependencies  
- **React** – A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing a component-based architecture for dynamic and interactive web applications.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – A utility-first CSS framework that simplifies styling with pre-defined classes, enabling rapid UI development.  
- **Three.js** – A JavaScript library for rendering 3D graphics in the browser using WebGL, used to create the real-time animated background.  
- **Framer Motion** – A powerful animation library for React, enabling smooth transitions and interactions.  
- **Recharts** – A charting library for React that simplifies data visualization with customizable, responsive graphs.
